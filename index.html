            <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p> I'm from Lafayette, Indiana, was a swimmer most of my life, and when I wasn't doing that, I was either playing in a band, or was playing video games. I went to college originally for computer science, but left after a couple years, and moved to Tennessee to tak part in a men's discipleship program called the Narrow Gate Foundation. I spent the next several years working various jobs, and achieving my CompTIA A+ certification and working various jobs doing helpdesk work. </p><br>
            <p> When I'm not working, you're likely to find me checking out a local brewery, or at a metal concert. If you wanna get me talking, bring up anything Star Trek related, video games, Survivor, or pro wrestling. </p><br>
            <br>
            <h2>Why Am I Here?</h2>
            <p> I'm going through this class and starting this journey out of an interest of closure, aznd I hope it will lead to a successful career in development. Not sure what my plans are beyond that, but I'm hoping to finally find something stable that will allow me to be in a position to continue in a career in web development. Continue to follow along to watdch my journey as I learn more about HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and more. </p>
